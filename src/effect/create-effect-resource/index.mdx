# `createEffectResource<A, E>`

`createEffectResource` is a utility for creating a `Resource` that runs an asynchronous `Effect`.
This is used inside of `RunAsync` and `RunAsyncExit` to convert the effect into a resource.

### Signature

`<A, E>(options?: ResourceOptions<A>) => [Resource<A>, Setter<Effect.Effect<A, E, R> | null>, ResourceActions<A | undefined>]`

It takes in [resource options](https://docs.solidjs.com/reference/basic-reactivity/create-resource#options) (optional),
and it returns (in an array), a resource, a signal setter for the effect, and resource actions (`{ mutate, refetch }`).

It is equivalent to the following:

```tsx
// Where runtime is the default runtime or custom runtime.
const [effect, setEffect] = createSignal<Effect.Effect<A, E, R> | null>(null);
const [resource, options] = createResource<A, Effect.Effect<A, E, R>>(
  effect,
  (src) => Runtime.runPromise(runtime)(src),
);
```

It is useful when you need run an `Effect` but the result might not be mapped directly to a JSX element.
For example, in cases where the resource is used by many components.

## Example

```tsx
// This example is in a complex social media web app that fetches info based on the path.
// On navigation, routes set the effect to fetch the correct data and put it into a form consumable by app components.
export const [appMeta, setAppMetaEffect] = createEffectResource<AppMeta>();

// Later, in a route that contains an effect called QUERY.
export function RootPath() {
  onMount(() => {
    setAppMetaEffect(QUERY);
  });

  return null; // The route doesn't do anything, the app handles the rest.
}

// Later, in an app component.
export function UserInfo() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback="Loading">
      <p>{appMeta().userInfo.name}</p>
      <p>{appMeta().userInfo.score}</p>
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

# solid-effect

[Effect](https://effect.website/) is a standard library for TypeScript, offering great data structures and utilities for a variety of problems.

[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) is a frontend framework that offers fine-grained reactivity and incredible performance.

Wouldn't it be cool if the experience between these two libraries was seamless?

That's where solid-effect comes in, providing utilities for integrating Effect into SolidJS.

Many of the components simplify what could be achieved with built-in SolidJS components using Effect utilities.

For example, mapping an `Option` to a JSX element:

```tsx
const value = Option.some("Text");

const result = () =>
  pipe(
    value,
    Option.map((x) => x.toUpperCase()),
    Option.getOrUndefined,
  );

<Show when={Option.isSome(value)}>{result()}</Show>;
```

is simplified to:

```tsx
const value = Option.some("Text");

<MapOption on={value}>{(x) => x.toUpperCase()}</MapOption>;
```
